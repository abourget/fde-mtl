### Faits / Probl√®mes / Solutions

The [Case method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_method) was developed at
the Harvard Business School at the end of the 18th century and is widely used in
medical, business administration and law schools.

The IFFD applied this method to the challenges of communication in the couple
and the family.

In each step of the application, emphasis is given to:

1. **Facts**: events, affirmations or situations inside the case, on which **all
   participants agree**.  They are not interpretations, presumed or plausible
   causes. They are **obvious facts**.

2. **Problems**: events, affirmations or situations in the case which are not
   resolved by the case at hand.  Facts tend to point to problems that do not
   always surface directly in the case.  **Specific** problems of the family
   life have **root causes** which need to be brought to light during
   discussions in small groups and plenary sessions.

3. **Solutions**: they should be **tangibles**, as **practical** as the facts
   from which they stem, and must address a specific problem, ideally its root
   cause identified by the group.



### The application of the method

In the context of IFFD courses, the method is applied as such:

1. Each participants reads the case.
2. Each couple discusses the case together.
3. Each small group meet somewhere (at some participant's home if possible) to discuss the case.
4. All participants gather in the plenary session -- moderated by an expert -- to discuss the case further, exchange on the visions each one has and find more and better solutions.

The systematic work, the application of the method in everyday life is what transformed the life of more than 25 000 couples throughout the world already.
