IFFD (International Federation for Family Development) is organizing its first Digital Congress on the topics of Sexuality and Affectivity. There will be conferences by over 40 international experts on these topics.

The conference takes place on June 4-5th 2022.

The Standard ticket includes access to the talks for the weekend of June 4-5. The Premium ticket includes access for six months, so the talks can be re-watched or watched at a slower pace.
