title: Announcing the creation of Golang Montréal

---

We are thrilled to announce the creation of Golang Montréal, a Go user group
whose mission is promote the growth of a lively and dynamic community of Go
enthusiasts in Montreal and its surroundings.

Golang Montréal will be holding monthly meetups with presentations from the
community and for the community. It is a great way to discover this great
language, to meet fellow gophers, to learn new tricks and uncover new and
exciting opportunities.

Our first meetup will be held at **Google Montreal** on **Monday, February
22nd 2016**. We will announce the talks 1-2 weeks before.

PLEASE NOTE that because of access controls in place at the Google offices,
everyone will need to [register on the Meetup.com page](http://www.meetup.com/fr-FR/GolangMontreal/events/228221625/) (it's **free**) at least 24 hours before the event.

If you are passionate about Go or you know something that we don't, come and
share it with the community!  Send your proposal for talks (lasting 5, 15 or 30
minutes) to <a
href="mailto:team@golangmontreal.org">team@golangmontreal.org</a>.  Giving talks
in public events such as this one is guaranteed to positively impact your
career.

The organizing team also encourages anyone interested in leading this initiative
with us, to contact us.  We promise loads of opportunities!
