### Activities

Golang Montréal is a group of users of the Go programming language.

Our goal is to build a strong local community by putting together programmers,
project leaders, artists and service providers.

Our main events are the _Golang Montréal meetups_, some mini-conferences that
occur each 4 to 6 weeks.  They take place during week-day evenings, and usually
+last about 2 hours. They feature talks from 5 to 45 minutes that cover a broad
ranges of subjects and cater to people of a wide range of skillsets: newcomers
to experts.

### Attendees

We attract Go enthusiasts, beginners and advanced alike.  We expect around 30-50
attendees at each meetups.  The startup community is also well represented - it
seems Go have taken some ground there.

### Why sponsor

Golang Montréal is strongly committed to providing value and exposure to our
sponsors. Sponsorships also help us to keep the events free of charge: a key
point of our success.

By sponsoring Golang Montréal, you will:

* Foster the growth of a healthy local community;

* Make yourself known to top programmers, lead developers and very smart people
  who might be interested in working for you — now or later;

* Gain visibility for both recruiting and promotion of your product and
  services: banners, quick introduction, etc.;

* Increase your profile in this very smart community of leaders in their field.
