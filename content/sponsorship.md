### Activities

Golang Montréal is a group of users of the Go programming language.

Our goal is to build a strong local community by putting together programmers,
project leaders, artists and service providers.

Our main events are the _Golang Montréal meetups_, some mini-conferences that
occur each 4 to 6 weeks.  Conferences happen during the week, on evenings, and
last about 2 hours.  They feature talks from 5 to 45 minutes that cover a broad
ranges of subjects, and address different expertise levels to keep everyone
interested.

### Attendees

We attract Go enthusiasts, from beginners to advanced.  We expect around 30-50
attendees at each meetups.  The startup community is well represented as Go is
considered more and more when building new companies.  Several company CTOs are
also known to come around.

### Why sponsor

We have a strong commitment to the exposure of our sponsors. Sponsorships helps
us to keep the events free of charge which is a key point of our success.

By sponsoring Golang Montréal, you will:

* Foster the growth of a healthy local community;

* Make yourself known to top programmers, lead developers and very smart people
  who might be interested in working for you — now or later;

* Gain visibility for both recruiting and promotion of your product and
  services: banners, quick introduction, etc.;

* Increase your profile in this very smart community of leaders in their fields.
