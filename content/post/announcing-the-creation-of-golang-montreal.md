title: Announcing the creation of Golang Montréal

---

We are thrilled to announce the creation of Golang Montréal, a Go user group
whose mission is promote the growth of a lively and dynamic community of Go
enthusiasts in Montreal and its surroundings.

Golang Montréal will be holding monthly meetups with presentations from the
community, for the community. It is a great way to meet fellow gophers, learn
new tricks, find opportunities or discover this great language for the first
time.

Our first meetup will be held at **Google Montreal** on **Monday, February
22nd 2016**. We will announce the talks 1-2 weeks before.

PLEASE NOTE that because of access controls in place at the Google offices,
everyone will need to register on the Meetup.com page at least two days before
the event, on Feb 22nd.

If you are passionate about Go or you know something that we don't, come and
share it with the community!  Send your proposal for talks (lasting 5, 15 or 30
minutes) to alex@bourget.cc.  Giving talks in public events such as this one is
guaranteed to influence your career path.

The organizing team also encourages anyone interested in leading this initiative
with us, to contact us. Having a leadership position in such an initiative
always brings tons of opportunities.

In the meantime, stay connected !
