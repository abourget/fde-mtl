title: Announcing the creation of golang montreal

---

We are thrilled to announce the creation of Golang Montréal, a Go user group
whose mission is promote the growth of a lively and dynamic community of Go
enthusiasts in Montreal and its surroundings.

Golang Montréal will be holding monthly meetups with presentations from the
community, for the community. It is a great way to meet fellow gophers, learn
new tricks, find opportunities or discover this great language for the first
time.

Our first meetup will be held at *Google Montreal* on *Monday, February
22nd 2016*. We will announce the talks 1-2 weeks before.

If you are passionate about Go or you know something that we don't, come and share it
with the community!  Send your proposal for talks (lasting 5, 15 or 30 minutes)
to team@golangmontreal.org
[REVIEW: we could make this more snappy, we want to convince them to do it.. let’s give them a reason]

The organizing team also encourages anyone interested in leading this initiative with us, to contact us. Having a leadership position in such an initiative always brings tons of opportunities.

In the meantime, stay connected !
