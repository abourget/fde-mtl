Family, Development and Education (FDE) is a non-profit  affiliated to
[Family Development Canada](http://www.familydevelopment.ca/) and to the
[International Federation for Family Development](http://iffd.org), a NGO that
is in [General Consultative Status](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consultative_status#General) with the [United Nations](http://www.un.org).

_FDE_ offers the _Family Enrichment_ courses from IFFD, that help couples
improve their parental skills, and better their family life.

For more than four decades, tens of thousands of married couples around the
world benefited from these courses.
