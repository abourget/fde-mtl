Family, Development and Education (FDE) is a non-profit  affiliated to
[Family Development Canada](http://www.familydevelopment.ca/) and to the
[International Federation for Family Development](http://iffd.org), a NGO that
is in [General Consultative Status](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consultative_status#General) with the [United Nations](http://www.un.org).

_FDE_ offers the _Family Enrichment_ courses from IFFD, that help couples
improve their parental skills, and better their family life.

For more than four decades, tens of thousands of married couples around the
world benefited from these courses.

_FDE Montreal_ is responsible for bringing those courses to the greater Montreal
area.


## Mission

Our aim is to aid in the formation of happy families around Montreal. We do this by:

* Helping to strengthen the marriage bond between spouses.
* Assisting parents in the challenge of raising and educating their children.
* Facilitating the interaction and exchange of ideas and experiences among couples

We achieve the above primarily by offering IFFD courses that are delivered in a professional yet friendly ambience.
