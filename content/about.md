### What is Go

[Go](https://golang.org) is an open-source language built by Google. It was
design with simplicity in mind. It is a compiled language, with static typing,
garbage collection, great tooling, excellent concurrency primitives and a robust
standard library. It compiles blazingly fast, and cross-compiles to all major
platforms with one command. With Go, you get roughly the speed of C/C++ with the
development proficiency of Python (minus the GIL).

See also [Go by example](https://gobyexample.com/) and the
[Go book](https://www.golang-book.com/).

### Mission

Golang Montréal's mission is to promote the growth of a lively and dynamic
community of Go enthusiasts in Montreal and its surroundings.

Golang Montréal aims to disseminate knowledge about the language and to promote
its use.

Golang Montréal promotes Free and Open Source Software, encourages contributions
to Free Software projects and publishes its software and creative assets as open
source.


### Activities

We have regular meetings consisting of several short presentations followed by a
longer main presentation.

Attendance is free and open to all. Our sponsors often allow us to have snacks
and drinks to foster a climate where discussions are welcomed and appreciated.

We will often present concepts in layman terms and as such our meetings will
cater to people of all skill set levels: newcomers as well as experts.
