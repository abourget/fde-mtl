# Mission

Golang Montréal's mission is to promote the growth of a lively and dynamic
community of Go enthusiasts in Montreal and its surroundings.

Golang Montréal aims to disseminate knowledge about the language and to promote
its use.

Golang Montréal promotes Free and Open Source Software, encourages contributions
to Free Software projects and publishes its software and creative assets as open
source.


# Activities

We have regular meetings consisting of several short presentations followed by a
longer main presentation.

Attendance is free and open to all. Our sponsors often allow us to have snacks
and drinks to foster a climate where discussions are welcome and appreciated.

We will often present concepts in layman terms and as such our meetings will
cater to people of all skill set levels: newcomers as well as experts.
