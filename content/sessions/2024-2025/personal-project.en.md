This course is designed to help young professionals plan and
live rich, productive lives, whether it be in their career, their relationships
or their future marriage.

to approach your personal and professional lives.

Topics, such as:

* Life as a personal project
* Freedom, responsibility and engagement
* Family and work
* Emotional life and emotional intelligence
* Married Love
* Marital Communication
