An **Adolescence** course is planned for January 2025, on the South Shore of Montreal.

---

This course is for parents with children around 14 to 16 years old.

Between the conflicts and crisis of this phase, many of the values transmitted
by the family during infancy, begin now to dull, be contrasted and assimilated.

In this course, parents discover the value of their adolescent children and
discover how to efficiently communicate in moments of crisis. In addition, they
will analyze the social tendencies that impact the development of their
adolescent's fragile personality.

Topics:

* Crisis and Challenges of Adolescence
* Celebrating Uniqueness
* Teenagers and Responsibility
* Educating for Love
* Time to Flourish
* Making Marriage Stronger
* Knowing your Teenager
