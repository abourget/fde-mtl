Starting October 20th 2018, FDE Montreal offers the **Personal Project** course in Montreal.

This course is designed to help singles in their 20'sand early 30's plan and
live rich, productive lives, whether it be in their career, their relationships
or their future marriage.

The topics will be discussed using the case-study method (pioneered by Harvard
Business School). This provides a practical and objective framework with which
to approach your personal and professional lives.

September 23rd is a zero session (open to all), and a demonstration of the methodology.

Registration is required to participate in the course that runs from October
2018 to April 2019.

Topics:

* Life as a personal project
* Freedom, responsibility and engagement
* Family and work
* Emotional life and emotional intelligence
* Married Love
* Marital Communication
* The transcendent dimension of the human being
