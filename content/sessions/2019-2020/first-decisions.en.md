During the year 2019-2020, FDE Montreal offers the **First Decisions** course in Dorval.

*NOTE*: A minimum of 15 registered couples is required before this course is
confirmed. There is also a maximum of 30 couples for this session.

---

This course is for parents with children from 8 to 11 years old.

In this age range, children feel comfortable in their environment. They thus find themselves making a wide range of personal decisions in many daily situations. To assist them in making good choices, it helps to provide them with a scale of values, a reference.

In this course, parents analyze the importance of living according to a scale of values and also learn how to transmit these same values to their children.

Topics include:
* Character
* Family Life
* Strengthening the Will
* The use of leisure time; reading, sports and the media
* Mutual Understanding in Marriage
* Educating for Love
* Family and School
* Authority and Responsibility
