During the year 2019-2020, FDE Montreal offers the **First Decisions** course in Dorval.

*NOTE*: A minimum of 15 registered couples is required before this course is
confirmed. There is also a maximum of 30 couples for this session.

---

This course is for parents with children from 8 to 11 years old.

In this age range, children feel comfortable in the environment in which they find themselves. As a consequence they find themselves making a wide range of personal decisions in many daily situations. To assist them in making good choices, children need to have a scale of values to use as a reference.

In this course, parents analyze the importance of living according to a scale of values and also learn how to transmit these same values to their children.
