The community will thank you for the wisdom, and your career for the
opportunities this will bring to you.

* If you've done a few presentations in the past, send us an outline of what you'd
  like to talk about and we'll find a spot in the meetups that make sense.

* Even if you're new to presenting, we still want to hear from you. Send us your
  ideas and, together, we'll find an angle that will make everyone happy.
