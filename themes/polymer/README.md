# Polymer by abourget

This polymer-based theme is based on [pdevty's
work](https://github.com/pdevty/polymer) but has been heavily modified, and made
Multilingual aware.

It also has a few features specific for meetup groups, like sponsors data
structure and events data rendered to maps and structured data.

This theme is otherwise a polymer-based, web components and material design
theme for [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/).
