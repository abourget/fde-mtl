Contributing
============

To modify the site, you need:

* A GitHub account (create one here: https://github.com/join)
  * Ask Alexandre Bourget to grant you write access
* Navigate the different sections (most probably in `/content`)
  * Click the little pencil and modify the content.
  * Save and write a small summary of your changes (like Wikipedia :).

The special syntax used through is called Markdown. [Here is a guide to get you started](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).
